# Â¡Meterpostigo!

Provide endpoints to post readings from home made internet connected devices and
consume collected values via an API.

This is a "free" IoT platform for devices that I have built. The devices measure
simple things such as temperature and humidity, and they need some place to post
the values they collect.

## To build

Run `make`. It will compile the binary into `bin/`.

## To run

After building the binary, run it: `bin/meterpostigo`.

## To change

### To make a DB migration

### To add an endpoint
